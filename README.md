# Assets and Plots of my Bachelors Thesis

This contains all graphics and plots i created for my bachelor's thesis, including the code for plot generation and simulations.
I bundled the necessary functions in a julia package. It can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/onecalfman/IntegratedOscillatorModel.jl).
